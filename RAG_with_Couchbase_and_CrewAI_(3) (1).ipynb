        "In this guide, we will walk you through building a powerful semantic search engine using [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com) as the backend database and [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) for agent-based RAG operations. CrewAI allows us to create specialized agents that can work together to handle different aspects of the RAG workflow, from document retrieval to response generation. This tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear, step-by-step instructions that will equip you with the knowledge to create a fully functional semantic search system from scratch.\n",

        "You can either:\n",
        "- Download the notebook file and run it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)\n",

Unlike the FTS index, which is used for text-based search, the vector store is specifically designed to handle embeddings and perform similarity searches. When a user inputs a query, the search engine converts the query into an embedding and compares it against the embeddings stored in the vector store. This allows the engine to find documents that are semantically similar to the query, even if they don't contain the exact same words. By setting up the vector store in Couchbase, we create a powerful tool that enables our search engine to understand and retrieve information based on the meaning and context of the query, rather than just the specific words used."

        "1. **Research Expert Agent**:\n",
        "   - Receives the user query\n",
        "   - Uses the vector search tool to retrieve relevant documents from Couchbase\n",
        "   - Analyzes and synthesizes information from retrieved documents\n",

        "\n",
        "#### How the Process Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Query Processing**: User query is passed to the Research Agent\n",
        "2. **Vector Search**: Query is converted to embeddings and matched against document vectors\n",
        "3. **Document Retrieval**: Most similar documents are retrieved from Couchbase\n",
        "4. **Analysis**: Research Agent analyzes documents for relevance and extracts key information\n",
        "5. **Synthesis**: Research Agent combines findings into a coherent summary\n",
        "6. **Refinement**: Writer Agent restructures and enhances the content\n",
        "7. **Response Generation**: Final polished response is returned to the user\n",
